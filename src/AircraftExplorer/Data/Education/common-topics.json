    "category": "HowItWorks",
    "content": "Airplane wings generate lift through a combination of Bernoulli's principle and angle of attack. The wing's curved upper surface causes air to travel faster over the top, creating lower pressure compared to the underside. Simultaneously, the wing is angled slightly upward relative to the oncoming airflow, deflecting air downward and producing an equal and opposite upward force. These two mechanisms work together to overcome gravity and keep the aircraft airborne.",

    "content": "A turbofan engine generates thrust through two streams of air. The core stream passes through the compressor, combustion chamber, and turbines, similar to a pure turbojet. The bypass stream is accelerated by the large front fan but flows around the core without being combusted. Modern high-bypass turbofans route five to ten times more air through the bypass duct than through the core. This produces thrust more efficiently because accelerating a large mass of air by a small amount creates the same thrust as accelerating a small mass by a large amount, but with far less energy wasted as noise and heat. This principle explains why modern engines are both quieter and more fuel-efficient than older designs.",

    "content": "Autoland capability allows the aircraft to perform a fully automatic approach, flare, and touchdown in extremely low visibility conditions. The system requires precision ILS signals (Category II or III), redundant autopilot engagement, and functional autothrottle. During a Category IIIA autoland, the aircraft can land with a decision height as low as 50 feet and runway visual range of 600 feet. Category IIIB allows landing with no decision height and 150-foot visual range. The autopilot follows the ILS localizer and glideslope signals with extreme precision, commands the flare maneuver based on radio altimeter data, and maintains runway alignment through rollout. Autoland requires specific crew training, aircraft equipment certification, and airport facility approval to be used operationally.",

    "category": "Operations",
    "content": "Aircraft cargo holds are divided into compartments below the passenger cabin, each accessible through powered cargo doors on the aircraft's lower fuselage. Cargo is loaded as either containerized unit load devices (ULDs) or bulk items. ULDs are pre-packed at the airline's cargo facility and rolled into the hold on a system of powered rollers and ball mats built into the cargo floor. Each container locks into position using latches that engage with fittings in the floor. Weight and balance is critical: cargo must be distributed to keep the aircraft's center of gravity within certified limits. The loadmaster creates a load plan specifying which containers go in which positions. Forward and aft holds typically carry containerized cargo, while a smaller bulk compartment at the rear handles irregularly shaped items, mail, and late-arriving bags.",
