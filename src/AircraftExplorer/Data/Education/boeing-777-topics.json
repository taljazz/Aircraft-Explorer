It made its maiden flight on June 12, 1994, and entered service with United Airlines in 1995. The 777 was developed through an unprecedented working-together process with major airline customers, resulting in a twin-engine widebody that could replace aging three- and four-engine aircraft. The family has expanded to include the 777-200, -200ER, -200LR, -300, and -300ER variants, with the 777X series representing the next evolution.",

The successful evacuation demonstration proved that all passengers and crew could exit through half the available exits within the required time, using realistic conditions including simulated darkness and blocked exits.",
