It made its maiden flight on June 12, 1994, and entered service with United Airlines in 1995. The 777 was developed through an unprecedented working-together process with major airline customers, resulting in a twin-engine widebody that could replace aging three- and four-engine aircraft. The family has expanded to include the 777-200, -200ER, -200LR, -300, and -300ER variants, with the 777X series representing the next evolution.",

It replaces mechanical fuel control units with electronic computers that precisely manage fuel flow, variable stator vanes, bleed valves, and other engine parameters. The FADEC receives the pilot's thrust lever input as an electronic signal and computes the optimal fuel flow based on altitude, temperature, airspeed, and engine condition. It prevents the engine from exceeding temperature, speed, or pressure limits, and it manages engine starting automatically. The GE90 uses a triple-redundant FADEC system where three independent channels compare results, ensuring continued safe operation even if one channel fails. FADEC has dramatically improved engine reliability and reduced pilot workload.",

    "category": "Safety",
    "content": "The 777 fly-by-wire system includes an automatic rudder travel limiter that progressively reduces the maximum rudder deflection as airspeed increases. At low speeds during takeoff and landing, the full rudder travel of approximately 27 degrees is available to handle crosswinds and engine-out situations. As speed increases through the climb and into cruise, the maximum deflection reduces to as little as 3 degrees at high Mach numbers. This limiting prevents structural overload from excessive rudder forces at high speed, where even a small rudder deflection produces enormous side loads on the vertical stabilizer. The limiting is implemented in the primary flight computers and is transparent to the pilot, who experiences consistent pedal force characteristics regardless of the reduced travel at high speed.",

    "content": "The 777 family achieves exceptional fuel efficiency for its size class through several design features. The high-bypass-ratio GE90 engines convert fuel into thrust more efficiently than older engine designs. The supercritical wing airfoil minimizes wave drag at cruise Mach numbers. Raked wingtips on the 777-200LR and 777-300ER reduce induced drag at the wingtips. The fly-by-wire flight control system enables drag-reducing features like maneuver load alleviation and gust load alleviation. On a per-seat basis, the 777-300ER burns approximately 20 percent less fuel than the 747-400 it often replaces, while offering similar range and passenger capacity. These efficiencies translate to lower operating costs and reduced carbon emissions per passenger-kilometer.",
