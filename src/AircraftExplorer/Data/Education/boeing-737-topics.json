The original 737-100 and -200 series were short-range jets seating around 100 passengers. The Classic series (737-300, -400, -500) introduced CFM56 engines in the 1980s. The Next Generation series (737-600 through -900ER) brought a redesigned wing, glass cockpit, and improved range starting in 1997. The 737 MAX introduced LEAP-1B engines and split-tip winglets beginning in 2017.",

Blended winglets are smooth curved extensions at the wingtip that reduce induced drag by disrupting the wingtip vortex that forms as high-pressure air from below the wing curls around the tip. They provide approximately 4 to 5 percent fuel savings on longer routes. Split-tip winglets add an additional downward-pointing ventral strake, improving fuel efficiency by an extra 1.5 percent.

This tactile interconnection enhances crew coordination and situational awareness. The yoke requires more cockpit space and adds weight compared to a sidestick, but Boeing values the feedback advantages. The yoke also allows the pilot to apply large pitch and roll inputs simultaneously with one hand while managing thrust with the other, which some pilots find more intuitive during demanding maneuvers.",

On the 737, the yaw damper operates through the main rudder power control unit and is engaged for all phases of flight above approximately 1,000 feet. Failure of the yaw damper is not dangerous but makes the ride uncomfortable and increases pilot workload, requiring manual rudder coordination during turns.",

It occurs because swept-wing aircraft have more roll stability (dihedral effect) than yaw stability (directional stability). When the aircraft yaws to one side, the advancing wing generates more lift, causing a roll. The resulting sideslip then reverses the yaw, creating the oscillation. The phenomenon is named after the resemblance to a Dutch skating technique. Yaw dampers automatically suppress Dutch roll on modern aircraft, but pilots must be trained to recognize and manually dampen it if the yaw damper fails.",

The 737 NG incorporates this improved design along with a rudder system enhancement program that includes redundant input paths, force limiters, and independent pressure sources. These changes made the 737 NG rudder system one of the most thoroughly analyzed and safeguarded systems in commercial aviation.",

Pilots set trim using thumb switches on the yoke or a trim wheel on the center pedestal. The stabilizer trim system is also used by the autopilot and speed trim system to maintain pitch attitude. The jackscrew is a critical component, and regular lubrication and inspection are mandatory maintenance items.

When the pilot turns the control wheel, the flight spoilers on the descending wing rise proportionally to assist the roll. This asymmetric spoiler deployment increases the roll rate and reduces the aileron deflection needed, decreasing structural loads on the wing.

This automatic deployment dumps wing lift within one second of touchdown, transferring the aircraft's full weight to the wheels for maximum braking effectiveness. Ground spoilers can increase braking efficiency by up to 60 percent on a wet runway compared to brakes alone.
