  "description": "The Boeing 777-300ER (Extended Range) is the most popular and commercially successful variant of the 777 family, with over 800 deliveries. First delivered in 2004, it combines the stretched fuselage of the 777-300 with the raked wingtips and GE90-115B engines of the long-range variants. The 777-300ER offers both high passenger capacity (approximately 370 in three classes) and long range (7,370 nm), making it the backbone of many airlines' long-haul fleets and a common replacement for the Boeing 747-400.",
